# Agent Instructions


## Repository Instructions

This file is the canonical harness for AI agents working in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are relative symbolic links to `AGENTS.md` so every agent
reads the same guidance. Maintain all shared and agent-specific instructions here.

## Mandatory Contribution Workflow

Every coding agent MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before planning,
editing, testing, or reviewing changes and MUST follow its applicable requirements.
It is the repository's contribution policy, not optional background reading.

- Use its PR checklist as completion criteria, including integration with current
  `main` for PRs, unit and regression testing, and independent adversarial review.
- Pass this policy to delegated implementation and review agents. For agent-authored
  work, use a separate adversarial review agent when available, or an independent human.
- Report actual validation and review results and any missing checks in the handoff
  or PR. Never claim completion of checks that did not run or approval not received.
- Do not declare a PR ready to merge while required checks or review are missing or
  blocking findings remain. Document the gap and keep an incomplete PR in draft.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Testing**:
   - Always add unit tests for backend changes.
   - Frontend changes should have tests if possible.

2. **Code Style & Architecture**:
   - **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Codebase must follow DRY principle.
   - **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Required for all backend code.

3. **Refactoring**:
   - You are authorized to refactor code to align with DRY/OOP principles.
   - **Permission Required**: You MUST ask for user permission before significant refactoring.

4. **Localization (i18n)**:
   - Update translation files if there are changes to UI text or console messages.
   - Frontend translation rendering must use safe DOM construction. Do not inject translated strings with non-clearing `innerHTML`; allowlist any intentional links and build them as DOM nodes.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Always update `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` when making changes.
   - Keep `README.md` short and focused on ordinary users: setup, login, migration,
     and links. Detailed public instructions belong in `docs/`, the source for the
     GitHub wiki. Developer contribution policy belongs in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
   - Keep the marked upgrade warning at the top of `README.md` until v2.1.0 is
     released; then remove that notice and this reminder. It distinguishes users
     of v1.3.1/v1.3.2 who must sign in again from other users with valid saved logins.
   - Personal development plans, investigation notes, local verification records,
     and captures belong in `.dev-notes/`, which Git and Docker builds ignore.
     Never commit them or put them under `docs/`; this overrides skill templates
     that suggest committing `docs/plans/` or `docs/notes/`. Keep credentials out of
     public documentation, PRs, issues, and logs. Report concise, redacted validation
     results in the PR without publishing personal working records.
   - Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` as relative symbolic links to `AGENTS.md`; do not replace them with duplicated text. Put any agent-specific instructions in clearly named sections of `AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

Twitch Drops Miner is a Python application that automatically mines timed Twitch drops without downloading stream data. It uses Twitch's GraphQL API and websocket connections to simulate watching streams while tracking drop progress.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Python 3.12+ required
- Web-based GUI using FastAPI and Socket.IO
- Async/await architecture with asyncio
- Session persistence via cookies
- No stream video/audio download (bandwidth-efficient)
- Docker-ready for easy deployment

## Architecture


The application now uses a clean `src/` package structure with clear separation of concerns.

### Core Components

**main.py** - Simple launcher:

- Runs the `src` package as a module using `runpy.run_module("src")`
- All application logic is now in `src/__main__.py`

**src/__main__.py** - Entry point:

- Parses command-line arguments
- Initializes Settings, Twitch client, and WebGUIManager
- Starts the FastAPI web server (uvicorn on port 8080)
- Runs the main asyncio event loop
- Handles signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM on Linux) and exit codes

**src/core/client.py** - Central client (`Twitch` class):

- State machine: IDLE, INVENTORY_FETCH, GAMES_UPDATE, CHANNELS_CLEANUP, CHANNELS_FETCH, CHANNEL_SWITCH, EXIT
- Composes `_AuthState`, `HTTPClient`, and `GQLClient`
- Delegates to service layer for business logic
- Drop progress monitoring via periodic "watch" payloads
- Manages WebsocketPool and maintenance tasks

**src/services/** - Business logic layer (fully implemented):

- `ChannelService`: Channel management and selection logic
- `InventoryService`: Campaign and drop inventory operations
- `WatchService`: Drop mining watch payload logic
- `MaintenanceService`: Periodic maintenance tasks
- `MessageHandlerService`: Websocket message routing and handling


**src/models/channel.py** - Channel and Stream:

- `Channel` class: Twitch channel with online/offline status
- `Stream` class: Active stream with game, viewers, drop status
- Stream URL fetching and validation
- ACL-based vs directory channels

**src/models/campaign.py** - Drop campaigns:

- `DropsCampaign`: Campaign with game, timeframe, allowed channels
- Time-based eligibility and progress tracking
- Special Events (`509663`) and IRL (`509672`) are identified by `Game.is_special()`.
  Their campaigns can progress across categories only on live channels in a non-empty,
  enabled ACL. Without an ACL, the streamed category must still match. Explicit
  `ignore_channel_status=True` checks retain their discovery-only status bypass.
- `WatchService.can_watch()` requires the campaign's game in `wanted_games`, a live
  channel, and `campaign.can_earn(channel)`. Special categories bypass the channel's
  drops-enabled flag; regular campaigns still require it. Account eligibility, campaign
  and drop timing, prerequisites, claims, and ignore rules remain enforced.
- Channel priority still uses the streamed category; channels outside `wanted_games`
  retain `MAX_INT` fallback priority. Preserve special-category eligibility when changing
  watch selection; do not reintroduce an unconditional campaign/channel game equality gate.
- `WatchService.should_switch()` allows replacement of an unwatchable current channel
  before comparing priorities. Healthy streams keep the existing priority rules; tied
  `MAX_INT` participants must still take over after an offline or ineligible stream.

**src/models/drop.py** - Drop types:

- `TimedDrop`: Drops with minute requirements and progress
- `BaseDrop`: Base class with claim logic
- Precondition chains for sequential drops

**src/web/gui_manager.py** - Web GUI:

- `WebGUIManager`: Main GUI coordinator
- Composes individual managers for different UI concerns (status, console, channels, campaigns, inventory, login, settings, cache)
- Uses `WebSocketBroadcaster` for real-time Socket.IO updates
- Pure asyncio, no tkinter dependency

**src/web/app.py** - FastAPI application:

- REST API endpoints: `/api/status`, `/api/channels`, `/api/campaigns`, `/api/settings`, `/api/helper/connect`, `/api/helper/session`, `/api/helper/result`, `/api/reload`, `/api/cache/clear`, `/api/close`, `/api/version`, `/api/history`, `/api/history/export.csv`, `/api/history/stats`
- Socket.IO server for real-time bi-directional communication
- Serves static web frontend from `web/` directory
- Integrates with WebGUIManager via `set_managers()`
- The Settings **Clear All Cache** action discards local campaign, channel, and other
  derived miner state, preserves OAuth login and settings, and then reloads from Twitch.
  It is a recovery and diagnostic action, not a correction for Twitch campaign metadata.
- `serve_index()` replaces the `__APP_VERSION__` placeholder in local CSS/JavaScript URLs
  with the application version and serves `/` with `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- Any `app.js` or `styles.css` change requires an application version bump through the release
  workflow before deployment so existing clients receive a new asset cache key

**src/websocket/pool.py** - WebSocket management:

- Sharded connections (up to 50 topics per socket, max 199 channels)
- Topics: User.Drops, User.Notifications, Channel.StreamState, Channel.StreamUpdate
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message routing to registered callbacks

**src/config/settings.py** - Application settings:

- Games to watch list (auto-populated from available campaigns if empty)
- Games can also be added manually from the web settings search box. Exact and
  unique partial matches resolve to available game names; ambiguous matches do not
  add a game. Confirmations support keyboard focus and Escape. Select All preserves
  priority order and manual entries, and manual confirmation uses current settings.
- Games to Watch supports drag ordering and editable integer priority numbers. Clamp valid
  ranks to the list bounds; reject blank/fractional values without changing settings.
  Keep priority and remove-control labels translated and accessible. Regression tests in
  `tests/test_game_priority.py` cover order, bounds, invalid inputs, and persistence calls.
- Connection quality multiplier
- Language selection
- Proxy support (including verification)
- Logging and dump flags from command-line arguments
- Persistence to JSON file (`settings.json`) in DATA_DIR
- Drop-name ignore list (`drop_name_blacklist`), empty by default. Entries are literal,
  case-insensitive substrings entered one per line; whitespace and blanks are removed and
  duplicates are casefolded while preserving the first spelling/order.
- Inventory filters (Status, Benefit Type, Game Search); Active/Upcoming/Expired use
  OR semantics, Not Linked narrows the result, and Finished opts claimed campaigns in.
  Zero-minute subscription rewards are omitted from Inventory and Wanted Drops Queue;
  individually expired and non-mineable rewards are omitted from the queue without hiding
  upcoming or sequential rewards; successful claims refresh the queue immediately; the
  actively watched channel remains visible while game settings are changing
- Consecutive identical no-active-campaign console prompts are collapsed until another
  console message appears
- Telegram drop notifications use a bot token stored server-side. The web API/socket
  never echoes the stored token: `get_settings()` returns only a `telegram_configured`
  flag and a masked placeholder, console logs mask the value, and a submitted value equal
  to the mask (or empty) leaves the stored credential untouched.
- Telegram alerts originate in the shared `BaseDrop.claim()` successful unclaimed-to-claimed
  transition, covering websocket, startup, and inventory-refresh claims without duplicate
  alerts for repeated events. Telegram failures must not change a successful Twitch claim.
- The Telegram form reuses the saved token when its input is blank. Clearing the chat ID
  and saving disables alerts. Test Connection waits for settings persistence before showing
  success; HTTP, network, and application save failures must remain visible as errors.
- `tests/test_telegram_frontend.py`, `tests/test_telegram_api.py`, and
  `tests/test_telegram_integration.py` cover translated Help rendering, stored credentials,
  failed saves, disabling, all shared claim paths, and transport failures without sending
  real Telegram messages. Keep Telegram UI result strings in every locale.

Drop-name ignore policy is dependency-aware: a matching unclaimed drop and its dependent
branches are ignored dynamically. Prerequisite-only branches with no mineable reward are
skipped, while shared prerequisites required by an allowed reward remain mineable. Ignored
and skipped drops are never counted as claimed. Twitch can still award simultaneous
progress to an ignored drop while the miner intentionally targets another reward.

### State Machine Flow

1. **IDLE** - Waiting for campaigns or user action
2. **INVENTORY_FETCH** - Fetch campaigns from GraphQL, claim completed drops
3. **GAMES_UPDATE** - Determine wanted games based on priority/exclude lists
4. **CHANNELS_CLEANUP** - Remove channels not streaming wanted games
5. **CHANNELS_FETCH** - Discover channels via ACL lists or game directories
6. **CHANNEL_SWITCH** - Select best channel to watch based on priority/ACL
7. Loop between CHANNEL_SWITCH and periodic INVENTORY_FETCH (hourly)

### Authentication and helper-assisted login

- Helper-assisted login is TDM's standard authentication method for new or expired
  sessions. README guidance covers migration from existing Android/Smart TV sessions
  and normal helper use. Detailed user instructions live in `docs/authentication.md`.
  Keep personal investigation and scoped verification records in ignored `.dev-notes/`;
  do not present the current authentication flow as experimental.
- `Twitch` starts with `ClientType.ANDROID_APP` and reuses valid saved Android cookies.
  Preserve `cookies.jar`; fresh, expired, or wrong-client credentials wait for the helper.
  Fresh device authorization, direct remote-browser configuration, manual session upload,
  and the old pairing/renewal HTTP routes are retired. `TDM_SESSION_IMPORT` is not used.
- `ImportedSession` is always initialized. Accepted helper state takes precedence over
  preserved Android cookies after restart. Keep `Channel.url` on `ClientType.WEB.CLIENT_URL`
  for watch beacon discovery. Native/imported requests preserve the matching WEB client,
  device ID, OAuth token, integrity context and user agent. Do not log any of those values.
- `src/auth/helper_connection.py` owns short-lived helper admission, validation and
  server renewal. `POST /api/helper/connect` returns a 10-minute random bearer connection;
  `POST /api/helper/session` receives the existing ServerSeed envelope. Validate the original
  account/catalog, independently issue a new server context, and validate that same account
  before accepting. Initial proof may have a shorter fresh lifetime; normal renewal must
  advance capture/expiry and preserve account identity. Never accept an HTTP 200 alone.
- The Settings `allow_helper_connection` value defaults true. The authoritative flag,
  invalidation epoch, bundle, SDK cookie, account/generation and sanitized receipt are
  atomically persisted together in private `data/imported-session.json` v2. Settings
  mirrors this flag but does not persist a second copy in settings.json. Every toggle
  invalidates old tickets, including true→false→true; success commits false with the state.
  Existing v1 imported state migrates closed. Storage or validation failure preserves
  previous state. Disabled admission blocks connections/replacement, never server renewal.
- `GET /api/helper/result` recovers an accepted upload for its hashed connection for
  10 minutes, including after gate closure or restart. No credential values are returned.
  Native helpers reconcile lost/invalid/5xx acknowledgements without repeating the POST;
  an unconfirmed result is unknown, not a claim that installation failed.
- The native helper recognizes only the fixed HTTP 503 `session_browser_start`
  rejection as `HELPER_SERVER_BROWSER`, because it precedes session installation.
  Unknown, malformed and gateway 5xx responses still reconcile through receipts;
  never replay the credential POST or echo arbitrary server error text.
- Helper protocol routes are admitted by the explicit setting, independently of optional
  dashboard auth. All other dashboard guards remain intact. Retain the write header,
  origin/Fetch Metadata checks, 64 KiB payload cap, no-store responses and fixed error codes.
  There is no session/seed export route. Ordinary dashboard status stays protected when
  dashboard authentication is enabled.
- `Twitch.authentication_change()` drains miner, watch, maintenance, fan-out campaign/UI/
  channel tasks, websocket callbacks and tracked online checks before replacing identity.
  Clear old topics and derived account state and resume under the accepted provider.
  Fan-out cleanup must cancel AND await children on parent cancellation. Channel tasks
  remain tracked after their pending display marker clears. Do not restore the old
  Android identity after an explicit accepted helper replacement.
- The integrated worker reads only persisted TDM state, normally renews five minutes
  before expiry, rotates SDK state and validates account/catalog before atomic replacement.
  It retries transient failures with bounded delay; exhausted/revoked credentials require
  reopening admission and running the helper. Shutdown cancels and drains in-flight
  uploads and renewal so browser cleanup finishes before process exit.
- `src/auth/server_renewal.py` owns temporary headless Chromium and Twitch SDK issuance.
  The standard Alpine Dockerfile includes Chromium; no Python runtime dependency was added.
  Docker uses an init process and a cleanup grace period. Mining GraphQL stays in Python
  HTTP. No browser/control/viewer port is published. Historical standalone renewal CLI
  code is not the current deployment interface; its removed HTTP destination cannot be
  used with this server. See `docs/authentication.md` for current setup.
- `src/auth/login_helper.py` and root `login_helper.py` implement direct local handoff.
  Keep setup instructions explicit about the two machines: run the native/source helper
  in the user's local desktop session with installed Google Chrome, and choose its
  archive for that desktop's OS/CPU. `--tdm` selects the reachable miner root URL;
  `--chrome` selects a local executable. A headless home server/NAS runs the miner
  and its temporary renewal Chromium without a desktop or display. An SSH session
  to that server does not run the helper on the user's desktop.
  Check admission before opening installed Chrome with a temporary owned TDM profile.
  Use an explicit nonzero loopback CDP port (port zero changes navigator.webdriver), verify
  the browser PID, and leave ordinary Chrome profiles untouched. Wait for Twitch login,
  capture in memory via shared BrowserExporter/SDKAcquisition, send directly to the chosen
  root URL without redirects, wait for verified acceptance, close Chrome and delete the
  owned profile. No exported JSON/seed/connection files are written locally.
  Scope Chrome's TMPDIR, TMP and TEMP to the owned profile so auxiliary files are removed
  with it; never delete or change the parent's shared temporary directory. Cancellation,
  SIGTERM and SIGHUP must finish bounded cleanup. Forced process kill/power loss cannot
  guarantee cleanup; never silently report successful cleanup if deletion failed.
- Native profile deletion may clear a Windows read-only attribute only on an owned
  file/directory that failed deletion. Do not follow symlinks or junctions, alter
  unrelated profiles, or suppress persistent locks/permission errors. A missing child
  is not proof that the profile root was deleted; retry while the root remains.
  Keep real Windows read-only cleanup and disappearing-child regressions covered.
- Linux desktop discovery currently checks native `google-chrome` and
  `google-chrome-stable`. Flatpak launchers and Firefox are not supported login
  backends; do not imply that `--chrome` accepts a shell command or bypass browser
  PID ownership checks to accept a sandbox launcher.
- Native console text lives in the top-level `helper` locale section and `HelperMessages`.
  `packaging/login_helper.spec` bundles translations and dependencies. PyInstaller is a
  pinned build-only dependency; build each target OS separately. CI builds and smoke-tests
  Linux x64, macOS ARM64/x64 and Windows x64, including startup without Python on PATH.
  The optional packaged browser smoke admits a short-lived local connection and checks
  installed Chrome startup, CDP control, login timeout and temporary-profile cleanup.
  Linux uses Xvfb for this display-dependent test; it never supplies account credentials.
  Report remaining temporary filenames on smoke failure without printing their contents.
  Preserve the auxiliary-file cleanup regression, including unchanged parent environment
  and unrelated files, when changing native browser launch or cleanup.
  The helper writes UTF-8 console output; subprocess tests must decode it explicitly as
  UTF-8 rather than using the Windows locale code page.
  Keep `DevToolsConnection` typed against its narrow websocket protocol (async iteration
  and `send_json`), compatible with both locked aiohttp and newer supported releases.
  Do not subscript the older non-generic websocket class or silence new type errors;
  inspect advisory CI Mypy output even when the enclosing job reports success.
  The dashboard download link targets GitHub releases; keep its archive/version guidance
  translated in every locale. PR build artifacts are an explicitly documented fallback
  for unreleased source, not evidence that a release exists.
- Preserve strict bundle/header/cookie allowlists, private atomic file writes, same-account
  renewal and accepted-catalog validation. Shared session/SDK primitives remain covered by
  their focused tests. Legacy BrowserSession is retained only for historical investigation,
  not selectable fresh login. Historical live evidence is not proof of a changed
  integrated flow. Keep personal provider, expiry, restart and native build evidence
  in ignored `.dev-notes/`; report redacted outcomes and limitations in the PR.
  Distinguish fresh login, renewal past the original expiry, restart, native build,
  and live mining checks. Success on one platform does not establish authenticated
  login on every OS or multi-day reliability. Preserve pending checks separately;
  never infer live drop progress from mocks or a Watching label.
- Imported-session GraphQL retries transient HTTP 5xx, connection and timeout failures
  only for exact known persisted read operations in the remaining request batch, with
  at most three attempts. Retry waits release the session lock, support stop/cancellation,
  and reject work whose account changed. Never replay ambiguous mutations, raw/unknown
  operations or already successful batch members. Keep public errors credential-free;
  `tests/test_imported_session_retry.py` exercises production GQL dispatch and HTTP replies.
- New backend and lifecycle coverage is in test_helper_connection/api/lifecycle,
  test_auth_task_cleanup and test_login_helper. Keep old Android cookie/restart coverage,
  account precedence, stale admission, atomic failure, lost-ack, gate-closed renewal,
  cancellation, redaction and owned-process/profile cleanup regressions.

### Dashboard authentication

- `src/web/auth.py` owns optional password-only dashboard protection, separate from Twitch
  OAuth and ordinary settings. It defaults off and stores a salted scrypt hash and SHA-256
  session-token digests in `data/web_auth.json` using atomic replacement; corrupt state must
  fail closed. Never expose these credentials in settings, broadcasts, validation errors,
  logs, or cache operations. Use one miner process per data directory.
- `AuthMiddleware` guards FastAPI and the outer Socket.IO ASGI app. Login resources,
  auth status, and `/healthz` are public when enabled; the three helper protocol routes
  use independent helper admission as described above. Unsafe HTTP requests require
  `X-TDM-Request: 1`; writes and Socket.IO reject foreign origins. `DashboardOrigin` in
  `src/web/origin.py` owns the optional `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` startup configuration: one
  absolute HTTP(S) root URL supplies the allowed browser origin and cookie scheme even
  behind an HTTP backend or rewritten Host. Normalize host/scheme/default ports and IP
  serialization to browser origins; reject ambiguous short/octal/hex IPv4 forms and
  credentials, paths, queries, fragments, wildcard/list origins, and malformed values
  without echoing them. Unset/empty preserves request-derived behavior. This configuration
  must not change ASGI scheme/client or trust forwarded headers; client-IP forwarding
  still requires explicit trusted proxies. HTTPS public URLs enable Secure cookies on
  set and delete. Preserve CSRF, Fetch Metadata, session/revocation, and rate-limit checks.
  `tests/test_web_public_url.py` covers both Socket.IO transports, production environment
  wiring, cookie lifecycles, hostile origins, and separate proxy-IP trust.
- Default cookies are HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookies. Remember me adds a fixed
  30-day Max-Age; server sessions also expire after 30 days and survive restarts. Logout
  revokes the current session; password changes require the current password and revoke
  other sessions. Disabling auth requires the current password and clears all credentials.
- `AuthSocketServer` rechecks authorization on events and broadcasts, disconnects revoked
  sessions, and schedules idle connections to close at expiry. Enabling auth must evict
  already connected anonymous clients before subsequent private broadcasts.
- `web/static/auth.js` owns login/settings behavior and adds the same-origin write header.
  A failed initial auth-status request must leave login available for retry without a
  reload; settings controls stay disabled until auth state is known.
  Keep all UI strings in `gui.auth` across all locales and render them using textContent.
  Local auth assets use the release version cache key; bump through the release workflow
  before deploying changes to existing auth assets, as with app.js and styles.css.
- `tests/test_web_auth.py` and `tests/test_web_auth_frontend.py` cover access control,
  credential persistence, cookie lifetimes, CSRF, rate limiting, revocation, and UI errors.
  The idle socket-expiry regression controls the auth wall clock and captures the
  scheduled callback. Preserve its remaining-lifetime, disconnect, and cleanup assertions;
  do not replace them with millisecond session lifetimes or fixed wall-clock sleeps.
  Docker checks `/healthz`, not the protected `/api/status`. Recovery is local: stop the
  miner, restrict access, remove only `data/web_auth.json`, restart and set a new password.

### Drop Mining Mechanism

The application sends periodic "watch" payloads through Twitch GraphQL `sendSpadeEvents`:

- Payload contains gzip/base64-encoded minute-watched events with channel/broadcast IDs
- Twitch reports progress via websocket (User.Drops topic)
- If websocket updates stop, fallback to GQL CurrentDrop query
- Extrapolation via "bump minutes" when no updates received

### GraphQL Operations

Persisted operations are defined in `src/config/operations.py` as `GQL_OPERATIONS`; raw GraphQL payloads such as `sendSpadeEvents` use `GQLQuery`:

- **Inventory** - Fetch in-progress campaigns and claimed benefits
- **Campaigns** - List available active/upcoming campaigns
- **CampaignDetails** - Detailed drop info for a campaign
- **GameDirectory** - Find live streams for a game with drops enabled
- **GetStreamInfo** - Check if channel is online and get stream details
- **CurrentDrop** - Query currently mined drop progress
- **ClaimDrop** - Claim a completed drop
- **AvailableDrops** - Check which campaigns a channel qualifies for (badge validation)
- **NotificationsDelete** - Delete Twitch notifications

### Channel Selection Priority

1. Selected channel (if user clicked one)
2. ACL-based channels over directory channels
3. Game priority order (from settings)
4. Viewer count (descending)
5. Maximum 199 channels tracked simultaneously

### Maintenance Task

Runs in background to trigger:

- Channel cleanup when drops start/end (based on time_triggers)
- Inventory reload every ~60 minutes

### Translation System

**Architecture:**

- All translations stored as JSON files in `lang/` directory (20 languages supported)
- English (`lang/English.json`) is the single source of truth and fallback language
- Strongly typed with TypedDict schema defined in `src/i18n/translator.py`
- Translator class (`src/i18n/translator.py`) handles language loading and fallback
- Singleton instance `_` available via `from src.i18n import _`

**Supported Languages:**

- English, Dansk (Danish), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish), Français (French)
- Magyar (Hungarian), Indonesian, Italiano (Italian), Nederlandse (Dutch), Polski (Polish), Português (Portuguese)
- Română (Romanian), Türkçe (Turkish), Čeština (Czech)
- Русский (Russian), Українська (Ukrainian), العربية (Arabic)
- 日本語 (Japanese), 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese), 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese)

**Translation Structure:**

```python
Translation = {
    "language_name": str,      # Display name of language
    "english_name": str,       # English name of language
    "status": StatusMessages,  # Console status messages
    "login": LoginMessages,    # Login-related messages
    "error": ErrorMessages,    # Error messages
    "gui": GUIMessages        # All web GUI text (tabs, settings, help, etc.)
}
```

**Usage:**

```python
from src.i18n import _

# Access translations
status_text = _.t["gui"]["status"]["idle"]  # Returns "Idle"
login_text = _.t["login"]["status"]["logged_in"]  # Returns "Logged in"
```

**Language Persistence:**

- Language selection persisted in `settings.json` (DATA_DIR)
- Dynamic language switching supported in web GUI
- Changes take effect immediately without restart

## Development Commands

**IMPORTANT: Always activate the virtual environment first!**

The project uses a virtual environment located at `env/`. All Python commands must be run within this environment:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment (required before any Python commands)
source env/bin/activate
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run from source (remember to activate venv first!)
source env/bin/activate && python main.py

# With verbose logging (stackable: -vv, -vvv)
source env/bin/activate && python main.py -v

# Create data dump for debugging
source env/bin/activate && python main.py --dump

# Access the web interface at http://localhost:8080
```

### Development Setup

The application requires:

- Python 3.12+
- Virtual environment at `env/` (must be activated before running commands)
- Dependencies from `pyproject.toml` (includes FastAPI, uvicorn, Socket.IO)
- Node.js 24 for frontend behavior tests

Docker deployment:

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests

The project includes a test suite in the `tests/` directory:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment and run tests
source env/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/
```

The suite covers settings and proxy behavior, inventory-filter behavior, API filtering,
GraphQL watch events, batched channel discovery, full-locale translation schema and
placeholder consistency, frontend DOM safety, case-insensitive channel filtering,
watch-drop count and expiry semantics, immediate claim refresh behavior, consecutive
no-campaign console collapsing, contributor README automation, and the claimed-drop
history store with CSV export and API endpoints. Frontend behavior tests
share their JavaScript extraction helper and use Node.js;
the validation workflow provisions Node 24 before running pytest. It also runs the release
script contract tests under `.github/scripts/test/`. Ignore-list coverage includes
normalization and settings persistence, dependency pruning, the combined expiry/ignore
Wanted Queue guard, watch selection, truthful ignored/skipped inventory state, translated
placeholder parity, and frontend rendering. Changes to `web/static/app.js` or
`web/static/styles.css` still require the release workflow to bump the application version
and asset cache key before deployment.

`tests/test_special_game_watch.py` covers Special Events and IRL across streamed categories,
missing category/drops flags, offline and nonparticipating channels, disabled or absent ACLs,
Games to Watch selection, campaign/drop eligibility, active-campaign selection, and fallback
priority and failover. It uses mocked Twitch state and does not verify live Twitch progress.

### Continuous Integration

- `.github/workflows/validation.yml` runs Ruff, Mypy, the Python test suite, language
  JSON validation, `uv lock --check`, release-script tests, and Docker build validation
  for pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- Docker validation and release workflows pin the Node-24-native Docker Buildx v4.3.0
  and Build Push v7.3.0 action commits. Update both workflows together when changing
  either action so validation and release builds use the same trusted versions.
- `.github/workflows/contributors.yml` credits the human author of each pull request
  merged into `main`, including linked pull request numbers in the alphabetically sorted
  Contributors table in `README.md`.
- The contributor workflow runs with write access through `pull_request_target`. It must
  only check out and execute trusted code from the default branch; never fetch or run
  pull request head code in that workflow.
- Keep the contributor table header and the `<!-- contributors:start -->` and
  `<!-- contributors:end -->` markers in `README.md`; the updater fails closed if the
  table header or either marker is missing, duplicated, or malformed.
- `.github/workflows/wiki.yml` publishes the eight public `docs/` guides to the GitHub
  wiki after relevant `main` pushes or manual runs on `main`. Keep `publish_wiki.py`'s
  explicit allowlist, relative-link rewriting, source-file links, and generated sidebar.
  Reject missing files, symlinks, and links to private or unpublished paths before
  writing output. Preserve unrelated wiki pages and history; never force-push.
  Check out the triggering SHA without stored checkout credentials, export before
  exposing `PUBLISHER_TOKEN`, and skip obsolete runs when the documentation, publisher,
  or workflow differs from current canonical `main`. Unrelated main commits must not
  suppress publication. Never run publishing with PR code or credentials
  available to a PR. `tests/test_wiki_publication.py` covers export boundaries, links,
  idempotence, isolated Git publication, and workflow trust. Keep private `.dev-notes/`
  outside Git, the Docker build context, and the wiki publication surface.
- `.github/workflows/version-release.yml` is the release entry point. It must provision
  `uv`, update `src/version.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` together, and validate all
  three before creating a release branch or tag.
  Version 2.0 introduces helper-assisted authentication and server Chromium; preserve
  its data-volume/cookie migration instructions and matching helper downloads. Prepare
  reviewed release notes before dispatch, then verify the published Docker architectures,
  source revision, four native archives, and checksums before reporting publication.
- `.github/workflows/login-helper.yml` is the read-only reusable native build workflow,
  called by both validation and GitHub release workflows. Build Linux x64, macOS ARM64/x64
  and Windows x64 from the caller's exact source SHA, then run packaged installed-Chrome
  smoke checks before archiving. `.github/scripts/prepare_helper_release.py` accepts only
  the four expected archives, containing a regular executable and LICENSE, and prepares
  versioned archives plus `SHA256SUMS` without extracting their contents. Keep the raw
  artifact download pattern separate from the aggregate artifact so reruns remain valid.
- `.github/workflows/github-release.yml` validates branch/package/lock versions and the
  existing version tag against the dispatched source commit before calling the native
  workflow. Only its final publishing job has `contents: write`; it waits for every
  platform and archive validation, and downloads assets from that same run.
  `.github/scripts/publish_helper_release.py` verifies local checksums, uploads only to a
  draft, then verifies all five remote asset names, sizes, states and SHA-256 digests
  before publication. Failed uploads leave a resumable draft. Refuse already-published
  targets before any write; never delete or replace public assets on a rerun. PR jobs
  never publish. `tests/test_helper_release.py` and `tests/test_helper_publication.py`
  cover artifact completeness, unsafe members, permissions, checksums, source/tag
  mismatches, workflow dependencies, upload failures, draft recovery and public reruns.
- Retired Docker interactive-browser and standalone-renewal recipes are removed. Do not
  revive the old browser URL environment variables or sidecar commands in current setup
  documentation; the standard Alpine image owns server renewal and the native helper
  owns fresh desktop login. Personal investigation records belong in ignored `.dev-notes/`.


### Manual Testing

1. Run with `-vvv` for maximum verbosity (levels: -v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv)
2. Check log files in `./logs/` directory
3. Monitor web GUI console output and browser developer tools

## Web GUI Architecture

The application uses a web-based interface accessible via browser:

### Web GUI Components

**src/web/gui_manager.py** - WebGUIManager class:

- Managers: StatusManager, ConsoleOutputManager, ChannelListManager, CampaignProgressManager, InventoryManager, LoginFormManager, SettingsManager, CacheManager
- Uses WebSocketBroadcaster to push real-time updates to connected clients via Socket.IO
- Pure async/await implementation

**src/web/app.py** - FastAPI application:

- REST API endpoints: `/api/status`, `/api/channels`, `/api/campaigns`, `/api/settings`, `/api/helper/connect`, `/api/helper/session`, `/api/helper/result`, `/api/reload`, `/api/cache/clear`, `/api/close`, `/api/version`, `/api/history`, `/api/history/export.csv`, `/api/history/stats`
- Socket.IO server for real-time bi-directional communication
- Serves static web frontend from `web/` directory
- Integrates with WebGUIManager via `set_managers()`

**web/** - Frontend assets:

- `index.html` - Single-page application layout with tabs (Main, Inventory, History, Settings, Help)
- `static/app.js` - Socket.IO client, real-time UI updates, API calls, Inventory Filtering and Drop History logic
- `static/styles.css` - Responsive design with dark mode support

### Communication Protocol

**Server → Client (Socket.IO events):**

- `initial_state` - Full state on connect
- `status_update` - Status bar changes
- `console_output` - New log lines
- `channel_add/update/remove` - Channel list changes
- `drop_progress` - Drop mining progress
- `campaign_add` - New campaign added
- `login_required` - Prompt for credentials
- `settings_updated` - Settings changed

**Client → Server:**

- REST API for actions (login, settings, channel selection)
- Socket.IO for connection management

### Docker Integration

**src/config/paths.py:**

- Detects Docker environment via `DOCKER_ENV` env var or `/.dockerenv` file
- Docker: Uses `/app` for code, `/app/data` for persistent storage
- Development: Uses `<project_root>/data` for persistent storage
- All user data (cookies, settings, cache, logs) stored in DATA_DIR
- Provides `_resource_path()` helper for locating bundled resources

**Dockerfile:**

- Based on `python:3-alpine`, including Chromium for internal SDK renewal
- Installs dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- Exposes port 8080
- Health check on the public `/healthz` endpoint

**docker-compose.yml:**

- Volume mounts `./data:/app/data` for persistence
- Port mapping `8080:8080`
- Auto-restart policy
- Timezone configuration

### Key Design Decisions

- **WebSocket for real-time** - Socket.IO chosen for reliability (fallback to polling)
- **Single-page app** - Simpler than full framework (React/Vue), fast load times
- **Direct Docker support** - Environment detection, proper path handling
- **Helper-assisted Twitch authentication** - Use desktop Chrome for login, transfer
  the session directly to TDM, and renew it on the server. Preserve valid saved Android
  sessions during migration.

## Project Scope

This is a hobby project for personal use on the user's own hardware and home network.
Support is limited to that setup and is provided on a best-effort basis. VPS, cloud,
other third-party hosting environments, and services operated for other users are
outside the support scope. Remote dashboard access and Docker support do not expand
that deployment scope. Keep the README disclaimer and contribution guidance consistent
with this policy when reviewing proposals or documenting deployment options.

**Supported:**

- ✅ Web GUI - browser-based interface with advanced filtering
- ✅ Docker deployment - containerized on the user's own home hardware
- ✅ Remote access - access to the user's home-hosted instance
- ✅ Headless operation - no display server required

**NOT supported:**

- Multi-account support
- Channel points mining
- Mining for unlinked campaigns
- Desktop GUI

### Claimed Drop History

`DropHistory` records successful claims locally in `data/drop_history.json`, deduplicated
by drop ID. The History tab provides game/date filters, pagination, statistics, CSV export,
and confirmed local deletion. Date-only filters mean midnight UTC; aware timestamps
preserve their instant. CSV attachment names use UTF-8 percent encoding with an ASCII
fallback. History text is defined in `gui.history` for every locale and rendered as text.
Tests cover persistence, filtering, Unicode exports, offsets, and translated UI behavior.
