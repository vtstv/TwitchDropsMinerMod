### Native login helper

Download the `tdm-login-helper-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz` asset matching your desktop:
`windows-x64`, `macos-arm64` (Apple Silicon), `macos-x64` (Intel), or `linux-x64`.
Extract the archive, run `tdm-login-helper` (`tdm-login-helper.exe` on Windows), enter
your TDM address, and sign into Twitch in its Chrome window. Wait for confirmed success;
TDM then renews the session on your home server without the desktop remaining open.
Chrome must already be installed; Python is not required. Binaries are unsigned.
`SHA256SUMS` contains checksums for all four archives.
